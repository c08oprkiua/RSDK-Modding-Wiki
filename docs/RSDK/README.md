# Retro Engine

The Retro Engine is a 2D video game engine created by [Christian Whitehead](TODO) and owned by [Evening Star](TODO). The engine is designed for retro-style games with pixel art graphics, supporting features such as palette manipulation, shape rasterization, and 3D floors and skies reminiscent of the Super Nintendo's [Mode 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_7) technology.



All RSDK versions have various common file formats that, with some variation between revisions, contain the same general information between all versions. The general overview of these formats can be found [here](), and specifics of what is in each format on a byte-for-byte level can be found under the subpage of each RSDK version.
